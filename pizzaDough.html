        <p>An easy recipe for pizza dough</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7g sachet dried yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>400g plain flour</li>
            <li>2 tsps salt</li>
            <li>3 Tbsps olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk yeast and water in a jug. Let stand for 5 mins or until frothy</li>
            <li>Place flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Pour in the yeast mixture and oil. Using your hands, mix the dough until it comes together and is smooth. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead briefly.</li>
            <li>Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling wrap. Set aside in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes to an hour until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently for another 5 minutes or until smooth. Divide dough and roll out pizza bases to desired size. Sprinkle a little flour on the bench before rolling to prevent dough from sticking. Your dough is now ready for your favourite pizza topping.</li>
